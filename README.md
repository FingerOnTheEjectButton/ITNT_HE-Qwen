## Setup

Install this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/openai/human-eval
pip install -e human-eval
```
For Windows ONLY. Fix entry-point:
```
human-eval/setup.py

content = content.replace(
    '"evaluate_functional_correctness = human_eval.evaluate_functional_correctness:None"',
    '"evaluate_functional_correctness = human_eval.evaluate_functional_correctness:main"'
)
```
For Windows ONLY. Fix evaluate_functional_correctness

## Usage (from [original github](https://github.com/openai/human-eval))

**This program exists to run untrusted model-generated code. Users are strongly
encouraged not to do so outside of a robust security sandbox. The [execution
call](https://github.com/openai/human-eval/blob/master/human_eval/execution.py#L48-L58)
in `execution.py` is deliberately commented out to ensure users read this
disclaimer before running code in a potentially unsafe manner. See the comment in
`execution.py` for more information and instructions.**

After following the above instructions to enable execution, generate samples
and save them in the following JSON Lines (jsonl) format, where each sample is
formatted into a single line like so:
```
{"task_id": "Corresponding HumanEval task ID", "completion": "Completion only without the prompt"}
```
We provide `example_problem.jsonl` and `example_solutions.jsonl` under `data`
to illustrate the format and help with debugging.

Here is nearly functional example code (you just have to provide
`generate_one_completion` to make it work) that saves generated completions to
`samples.jsonl`.
```
from human_eval.data import write_jsonl, read_problems

problems = read_problems()

num_samples_per_task = 200
samples = [
    dict(task_id=task_id, completion=generate_one_completion(problems[task_id]["prompt"]))
    for task_id in problems
    for _ in range(num_samples_per_task)
]
write_jsonl("samples.jsonl", samples)
```

To evaluate the samples, run
```
$ evaluate_functional_correctness samples.jsonl

```
This script provides more fine-grained information in a new file ending in
`<input_path>_results.jsonl`. Each row now contains whether the completion
`passed` along with the execution `result` which is one of "passed", "timed
out", or "failed".

As a quick sanity-check, the example samples should yield 0.5 pass@1.
